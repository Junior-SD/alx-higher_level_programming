Higher-level programming refers to the development of software using programming languages that provide a higher level of abstraction from the computer's hardware.
These languages are designed to be more user-friendly and allow developers to write code that is closer to human-readable form. 

Examples of higher-level programming languages include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. Higher-level languages offer built-in features, libraries, and frameworks that simplify common tasks, making development more efficient. They abstract away low-level details, such as memory management and hardware interactions, allowing developers to focus on solving problems and implementing functionality. Higher-level programming is commonly used for a wide range of applications, including web development, application software, and data analysis.
